# QE-GIPAW
This is the official Git repository of the GIPAW code for Quantum-Espresso.

## Features
* NMR shielding tensors, EFG tensors
* EPR g-tensor, hyperfine couplings
* MÃ¶ssbauer
* Norm-conserving (g-tensor only), USPP and PAW
* LDA and GGA functionals, +Hubbard U
* isolated and periodic systems
* integration with Quantum-Environment (solvent effects)
